# Dijkstras-algorithm-
This project was developed using visual studio 2019 within C#. The task for the project was to create a pathfinding algorithm that finds the shortest cave route in the least time. 

To get this project to run just simply download and go into the command line where the caveroute.bat file is located, type in "Caveroute Caveroute1" or "Caveroute Caveroute2" and it will find the fastest caveroute to travel through.
